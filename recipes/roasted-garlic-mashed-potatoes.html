    <p>If you are like me and love garlic, you will be swooning over these Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.</p>
    <p>These garlic mashed red potatoes are really easy to make. The thing that I wish could go faster is the time it takes to roast the garlic, but if you start the potatoes about halfway through the garlic roasting, it won't seem like it takes all that long. You can even roast them a day in advance then just rewarm them before adding to the potatoes.</p>
    <p>If you are head over heels in love with garlic, feel free to roast an extra head of garlic so you can top your serving with a few extra cloves.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds red potatoes, washed wwll and quartered</li>
        <li>Sal and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F</li>
        <li>Slice off the very top of the garlic head. Drizzle head with olive oil and wrap in foil. Place on a sheet tray and bake until tender and fragrant, roughly 35 minutes. Remove the cloves and mash with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Add salt and bring to a boil. Cook until fork tender and drain. Mash the potatoes until smooth.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile heat butter and cream until butter melts. Add the roaster garlic and potatoes and mash all together.</li>
        <li>Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
